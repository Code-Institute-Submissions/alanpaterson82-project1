# Yoga For Men

### A live demo of this project can be found at [Yoga For Men](https://alanpaterson82.github.io/project1/)

<br>

This is a website promoting new Yoga classes for men in the town of Millport on the Isle Of Cumbrae. It provides information on the class times and has images relating to the yoga practice. It's targeted toward men who are looking to join in with the classes, or those who are just showing an initial interest in this form of exercise as it also provides the benefits that come with it.

## Existing Features

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- HTML

## Testing

- The site has been tested in multiple search engines (Safari, Google Chrome and Firefox)
## Validator Testing

- There are two different CSS validation results, which appears to be a sparse as "family names containing whitespace should be quoted" (from https://validator.w3.org/), however, I have removed and re-added quotation marks to the font-family that was imported and the same error arises.

## Credits

- Icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Pexels](pexels.com) was used for all images in the gallery
- A significant portion of my code can be attributed to the Love Running project e.g use of .left-about headings, but values have been amended to demonstrate capability and 'tweak' my site. All other work is my own.
