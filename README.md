## Existing Features

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- HTML

## Testing
## Validator Testing

- There are two different CSS validation results, which appears to be a sparse as "family names containing whitespace should be quoted" (from https://validator.w3.org/), however, I have removed and re-added quotation marks to the font-family that was imported and the same error arises.

## Unfixed Bugs

## Credits

- Icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Pexels](pexels.com) was used for all images in the gallery
- A significant portion of my code can be attributed to the Love Running project e.g use of .left-about headings, but values have been amended to demonstrate capability and 'tweak' my site. All other work is my own.
