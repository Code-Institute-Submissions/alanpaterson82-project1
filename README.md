# Yoga For Men

### I have created a website promoting new yoga classes for men in the town of Millport on the Isle Of Cumbrae, North Ayrshire. It provides information on the class times and has images relating to the yoga practice. It's targeted toward men who are looking to join in with the classes, or those who are just showing an initial interest in this form of exercise as it also provides the benefits of getting involved.

<br>

### A live demo of this project can be found at [Yoga For Men](https://alanpaterson82.github.io/project1/)

<br>

### Gallery

- On a separate page there is the inclusion of various images to further promote yoga as a beneficial and relaxing past-time
- Visual aids are important to users and will further promote the benefits of yoga

<br>

## Technologies Used

<br>

- CSS
- HTML

<br>

## Issues


<br>
Time constraints meant that I was regrettably  unable to correct the below, but this can be done as and when required

<br>

- The site doesn't quite meet the responsiveness criteria, except for on tablets
- The cover text is not fully inside the hero image, but a workaround has been used
- The class times background image appears to be repeating 
- Clicking class times doesn't navigate to the relevant section
- The gallery images are too big, and should be scaled down

<br>

## Features Left To Implement

<br>

- Sign up page/ form
- Instruction video within the gallery
- Font awesome icons

<br>

## Testing

- The site has been tested in multiple search engines (Safari, Google Chrome and Firefox)

<br>

## Validator Testing

### CSS (Jigsaw Validator)

<br>

- There are two different CSS validation results below, which appear to be a sparse error as "family names containing whitespace should be quoted" (from https://validator.w3.org/), however, I have removed and re-added quotation marks to the font-family that was imported and the same error arises.

<br>

### HTML (W3C Validator)

<br>

- No errors found

## Deployment

<br>

I used GitHub to deploy the site by completing the below

- Clicking on the relevant repository from the GitHub homepage
- Clicking 'settings'
- From the dropdown, changing the branch from 'none' to 'main'
- Clicking 'save'
- When the page is refreshed the link is provided to be used for deployment

## Credits

<br>

- Icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Pexels](pexels.com) was used for all images in the gallery
- A significant portion of my code can be attributed to the structure of the Love Running project, but values have been amended to demonstrate my capability (where my knowledge allowed). All other work is my own and potential copying of any code has been completely unintentional
